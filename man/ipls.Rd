\description{
Applies iPLS alrogithm to find variable intervals most important for
prediction
}
\details{
The algorithm splits the predictors into several intervals and tries to find a combination 
of the intervals, which gives best prediction performance. There are two selection methods:
"forward" when the intervals are successively included, and "backward" when the intervals
are successively excluded from a model. On the first step the algorithm finds the best
(forward) or the worst (backward) individual interval. Then it tests the others to find the 
one which gives the best model in a combination with the already selected/excluded one. The 
procedure continues until the maximum number of iteration is reached. 
 
There are several ways to specify the intervals. First of all either number of intervals 
(\code{int.num}) or width of the intervals (\code{int.width}) can be provided. Alternatively
one can specify the limits (first and last variable number) of the intervals manually 
with \code{int.limits}.
