\usage{
randtest(x, y, ncomp = 15, center = T, scale = F, nperm = 1000,
  sig.level = 0.05, silent = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix with predictors.}

\item{y}{vector or one-column matrix with response.}

\item{ncomp}{maximum number of components to test.}

\item{center}{logical, center or not predictors and response values.}

\item{scale}{logical, scale (standardize) or not predictors and response values.}

\item{nperm}{number of permutations.}

\item{sig.level}{significance level.}

\item{silent}{logical, show or not test progress.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of \code{randtest} class with following fields:
\item{nperm }{number of permutations used for the test.} 
\item{stat }{statistic values calculated for each component.} 
\item{alpha }{alpha values calculated for each component.} 
\item{statperm }{matrix with statistic values for each permutation.} 
\item{corrperm }{matrix with correlation between predicted and reference y-vales for each 
permutation.} 
\item{ncomp.selected }{suggested number of components.}
}
\description{
\code{randtest} is used to carry out randomization/permutation test for a PLS regression model
}
\details{
The class implements a method for selection of optimal number of components in PLS1 regression 
based on the randomization test [1]. The basic idea is that for each component from 1 to
\code{ncomp} a statistic T, which is a covariance between t-score (X score, derived from a PLS 
model) and the reference Y values, is calculated. By repeating this for randomly permuted 
Y-values a distribution of the statistic is obtained. A parameter \code{alpha} is computed to 
show how often the statistic T, calculated for permuted Y-values, is the same or higher than 
the same statistic, calculated for original data without permutations.

If a component is important, then the covariance for unpermuted data should be larger than the 
covariance for permuted data and therefore the value for \code{alpha} will be quie small (there 
is still a small chance to get similar covariance). This makes \code{alpha} very similar to 
p-value in a statistical test.

The \code{randtest} procedure calculates alpha for each component, the values can be observed 
using \code{summary} or \code{plot} functions. There are also several function, allowing e.g. 
to show distribution of statistics and the critical value for each component.

\examples{
### Examples of using the test

## Get the spectral data from Simdata set and apply SNV transformation

data(simdata)

y = simdata$conc.c[, 3]
x = simdata$spectra.c
x = prep.snv(x)

## Run the test and show summary 
## (normally use higher nperm values > 1000)
r = randtest(x, y, ncomp = 4, nperm = 200, silent = FALSE)
summary(r)

## Show plots

par( mfrow = c(3, 2))
plot(r)
plotHist(r, comp = 3)
plotHist(r, comp = 4)
plotCorr(r, 3)
plotCorr(r, 4)
par( mfrow = c(1, 1))
