\description{
Shows how RMSE develops for each iteration of iPLS selection 
algorithm
}
\details{
The plot shows RMSE values obtained at each iteration of the iPLS selection
algorithm as bars. The first bar correspond to the global model with all variables
included, second - to the model obtained at the first iteration and so on. Number
at the bottom of each bar corresponds to the interval included or excluded at the
particular iteration. The selected intervals are shown with green color.
