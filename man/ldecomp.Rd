\details{
\code{ldecomp} is a general class for decomposition X = TP' + E. Here, X is a data matrix, 
T - matrix with scores, P - matrix with loadings and E - matrix with residuals. It is used, 
for example, for PCA results (\code{\link{pcares}}), in PLS and other methods. The class also 
includes methods for calculation and plotting residuals, variances, and so on.

There is no need to use the \code{ldecomp} manually. For example, when build PCA model 
with \code{\link{pca}} or apply it to a new data, the results will automatically inherit 
all methods of \code{ldecomp}.
