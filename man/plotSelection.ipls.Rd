\description{
Shows PLS performance for each selected or excluded intervals at the
first iteration
}
\details{
The plot shows intervals as bars, which height corresponds to RMSECV obtained when particular
interval was selected (forward) or excluded (backward) from a model at the first iteration. 
The intervals found optimal after backward/forward iPLS selection are shown with green color 
while the other intervals are gray.
