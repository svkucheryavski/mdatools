\description{
\code{pca} is used to build and explore a principal component analysis (PCA) model.
}
\details{
So far only SVD (Singular Value Decompisition) method is available, more coming soon. 
  
By default \code{pca} uses number of components (\code{ncomp}) as a minimum of number of 
objects - 1, number of variables and default or provided value. Besides that, there is also 
a parameter for selecting an optimal number of components (\code{ncomp.selected}). The optimal 
number of components is used to build a residuals plot (with Q residuals vs. Hotelling T2 
values), calculate confidence limits for Q residuals, as well as for SIMCA classification. 
  
If data contains missing values (NA) the \code{pca} will use an iterative algorithm to fit the 
values with most probable ones. The algorithm is implemented in a function 
\code{\link{pca.mvreplace}}. The same center and scale options will be used. You can also
do this step manually before calling \code{pca} and play with extra options.

### Examples for PCA class

## 1. Make PCA model for People data with autoscaling
## and full cross-validation

data(people)
model = pca(people, scale = TRUE, cv = 1, info = 'Simple PCA model')
model = selectCompNum(model, 4)
summary(model)
plot(model, show.labels = TRUE)

## 2. Add missing values, make a new model and show plots
peoplemv = people
peoplemv[2, 7] = NA
peoplemv[6, 2] = NA
peoplemv[10, 4] = NA
peoplemv[22, 12] = NA

modelmv = pca(peoplemv, scale = TRUE, info = 'Model with missing values')
modelmv = selectCompNum(modelmv, 4)
summary(modelmv)
plot(modelmv, show.labels = TRUE)

## 3. Show scores and loadings plots for the model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plotScores(model, comp = c(1, 3), show.labels = TRUE)
plotScores(model, comp = 2, type = 'h', show.labels = TRUE)
plotLoadings(model, comp = c(1, 3), show.labels = TRUE)
plotLoadings(model, comp = c(1, 2), type = 'h', show.labels = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

## 4. Show residuals and variance plots for the model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plotVariance(model, type = 'h')
plotCumVariance(model, show.labels = TRUE, legend.position = 'bottomright')
plotResiduals(model, show.labels = TRUE)
plotResiduals(model, ncomp = 2, show.labels = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

 Most of the methods for plotting data are also available for PCA results (\code{\link{pcares}})
 objects. Also check \code{\link{pca.mvreplace}}, which replaces missing values in a data matrix 
 with approximated using iterative PCA decomposition.
